          Growing up, my interest in computers never faded. Technology
          constantly amazes me, which led me to pursue a degree in Information
          Technology, where I was introduced to coding and web development. Fast
          forward to today, I&apos;ve had the privilege of building software for
          CIS Bayad Center Inc.

          In the past, I had the opportunity to start my journey into software
          development as a Quality Assurance intern at Cormant Technologies.
          This role provided me with my first exposure to the software
          development lifecycle, where I was able to witness the collaborative
          process of building and maintaining software systems.
          <span className="block h-3" />
          I pursued a QA role to deepen my understanding of software and develop
          critical thinking skills. This experience taught me attention to
          detail and sparked my passion for software development, laying the
          foundation for my journey as a developer.
          <span className="block h-3" />
          These days, my focus is on maintaining our product at Bayad Center. I
          love seeing my work and designs come to life — it&apos;s the most
          rewarding part of the process for me.
          <span className="block h-3" />
          When I’m not working, I love hanging out with my honeybuhn, driving
          around and finding cozy cafes, spending time with my family and mah
          dogs, or playing Dota.
